\section{Introduction}

The \package{REAP} (\textbf{R}enormalization group \textbf{E}volution of \textbf{A}ngles
and \textbf{P}hases) package is a Mathematica package to solve the
renormalization group equations (RGE) of the quantities relevant for neutrino
masses, for example the dimension 5 neutrino mass operator, the Yukawa matrices
and the gauge couplings.  So far, the $\beta$-functions for the standard model
(SM), the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) and the two higgs doublet
model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry (2HDM) with and without right-handed
neutrinos are implemented.  Heavy degrees of freedom such as singlet neutrinos
can be integrated out automatically at the correct mass thresholds which are
determined by a fixed-point iteration. Thus the evolution is described by
several effective theories.
In addition all models are implemented with Dirac neutrinos.  By means of the
\package{MixingParameterTools} package, the calculated running of the neutrino
mass matrix can be translated into the running of the mixing parameters and the
mass eigenvalues.
