\subsection[\package{RGESymbol}]{\package{REAP`RGESymbol`}}
\package{RGESymbol} defines several symbols which are used in exception handling
and as parameters in RGEGetSolution. 

%% These symbols are used in \package{RGESolver} to control automatically generated entries:\\
%%   \begin{itemize}
%%     \item RGEAutoGenerated is a tag to mark the EFT's which have been generated
%%   automatically or changed. It can have three different values:
%%   \begin{itemize}
%%   \item ``True'' means that the EFT has been generated automatically.
%%   \item ``False'' means that the EFT was not generated automatically.
%%   \item The name of some model means that the current EFT has replaced the given
%%   EFT. e.g. The current EFT is the SM w/o right-handed neutrinos (SM0N) and
%%   RGEAutoGenerated is set to ``SM''.
%%   \end{itemize}
%%     \item RGERemoveAutoGeneratedEntries determines whether automatically generated
%%   entries are removed.
%%   \end{itemize}
%% \item symbols used to return initial values
%%   \begin{itemize}
%%   \item RGEg1 is the coupling constant of $U(1)_Y$.
%%   \item RGEg2 is the coupling constant of $SU(2)_L$.
%%   \item RGEg3 is the coupling constant of $SU(3)_C$.
%%   \item RGEYu is the Yukawa matrix of the up-type quarks.
%%   \item RGEYd is the Yukawa matrix of the down-type quarks.
%%   \item RGEYe is the Yukawa matrix of the charged leptons.
%%   \item RGEY$\nu$ is the Yukawa matrix of the neutrinos.
%%   \item RGEM$\nu$r is the mass matrix of the right-handed neutrinos.
%%   \item RGE$\kappa$1 is the parameter of the dimension 5 operator associated
%%   with the first Higgs in the 2HDM.
%%   \item RGE$\kappa$2 is the parameter of the dimension 5 operator associated
%%   with the second Higgs in the 2HDM.
%%   \item RGE$\kappa$ is the parameter of the dimension 5 operator.
%%   \item RGE$\lambda$ is the quartic Higgs self coupling.
%%   \item RGE$\lambda$1 is $\lambda$1 in the Higgs potential of the 2HDM.
%%   \item RGE$\lambda$2 is $\lambda$2 in the Higgs potential of the 2HDM.
%%   \item RGE$\lambda$3 is $\lambda$3 in the Higgs potential of the 2HDM.
%%   \item RGE$\lambda$4 is $\lambda$4 in the Higgs potential of the 2HDM.
%%   \item RGE$\lambda$5 is $\lambda$5 in the Higgs potential of the 2HDM.
%%   \end{itemize}

%% \item symbols used in RGEModelOptions
%%   \begin{itemize}
%%   \item RGEu is a vector defining which Higgs the up-type quarks are coupling
%%   to.
%%   \item RGEd is a vector defining which Higgs the down-type quarks are coupling
%%   to.
%%   \item RGE$\nu$ is a vector defining which Higgs the neutrinos are coupling to.
%%   \end{itemize}

  

%% \item options used by RGEGetSolution
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item RGEAll is used to get the all parameters
%% \item RGECoupling is used to get the coupling constants
%% \item RGE$\alpha$ is used to get the fine structure constants
%% \item RGE$\lambda$ is used by RGEGetSolution to get the Higgs couplings,
%% e.g. the quartic Higgs self coupling in the case of the SM

%% \item RGEM$\nu$ is used to get the neutrino masses
%% \item RGEMe is used to get the charged lepton masses
%% \item RGEMu is used to get the up-type quark masses
%% \item RGEMd is used to get the down-type quark masses

%% \item RGEY$\nu$ is used by RGEGetSolution to get the Yukawa coupling matrix of
%% the neutrinos
%% \item RGEYe is used by RGEGetSolution to get the Yukawa coupling matrix of the
%% charged leptons
%% \item RGEYu is used by RGEGetSolution to get the Yukawa coupling matrix of the
%% up-type quarks
%% \item RGEYd is used by RGEGetSolution to get the Yukawa coupling matrix of the
%% down-type quarks


%% \item RGE$\kappa$ is used by RGEGetSolution to get $\kappa$.
%% \item RGE$\kappa1$ is used by RGEGetSolution to get $\kappa1$.
%% \item RGE$\kappa2$ is used by RGEGetSolution to get $\kappa2$.
%% \item RGEM$\nu$r is used by RGEGetSolution to get the mass matrix of the
%% right-handed neutrinos.

%% \item RGERaw is used by RGEGetSolution to get the raw values of the
%% parameters. A raw parameter is the internal representation of the parameter,
%% e.g. RGERawM$\nu$r returns a 2x2 matrix after the first right-handed neutrino is
%% integrated out, in contrast to RGEM$\nu$r which returns a 3x3 matrix.
%% \item RGERawM$\nu$r is used by RGEGetSolution to get the raw mass matrix of the
%% right-handed neutrinos.
%% \item RGERawY$\nu$ is used by RGEGetSolution to get the raw Yukawa coupling
%% matrix of the neutrinos.
%% \end{itemize}


%% \item symbols used by \function{RGESetInitial}
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item RGESuggestion specifies which default values are taken.
%% \item names of options accepted by RGESetInitial (see \ref{models})
  
%% \end{itemize}

%% \item names of options taken by the models (see \ref{models})
